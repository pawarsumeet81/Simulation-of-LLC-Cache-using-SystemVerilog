Instructions before running the code:
- open run.do file 
- rename "trace.txt" in the first line with the file name you want to run
- you can also change the mode by replacing "+mode2" with "+mode1" (optional)
- save the run.do file after making the above changes

Then you can use the command "do run.do" to simulate the design after compiling.
